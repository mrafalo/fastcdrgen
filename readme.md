# Fast CDR Generator

`fastcdrgen` is a high-performance tool for generating massive Call Detail Record (CDR) datasets. Using **Markov Chains**, it simulates realistic call and message patterns for both local and international users, providing a configurable way to model telecom datasets. 

## Features
- **Markov Chain-Based Simulation**: Generates realistic CDRs by modeling user behavior and relationships.
- **Highly Configurable**: Control the number of users, operators, BTS (base transceiver stations), and call/message distributions.
- **Flexible Output**: Easily set simulation parameters such as call durations, relationship types, and output filenames.
- **Multiple Use Cases**: Useful for testing telecom fraud detection, network analysis, and other telecom-related research.

## Configuration
The tool uses a configuration file to control the simulation parameters. Below is a sample configuration:
