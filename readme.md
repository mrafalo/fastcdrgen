# Fast CDR Generator

`fastcdrgen` is a high-performance tool for generating massive Call Detail Record (CDR) datasets. Using **Markov Chains**, it simulates realistic call and message patterns for both local and international users, providing a configurable way to model telecom datasets. 

## Features
- **Markov Chain-Based Simulation**: Generates realistic CDRs by modeling user behavior and relationships.
- **Highly Configurable**: Control the number of users, operators, BTS (base transceiver stations), and call/message distributions.
- **Flexible Output**: Easily set simulation parameters such as call durations, relationship types, and output filenames.
- **Multiple Use Cases**: Useful for testing telecom fraud detection, network analysis, and other telecom-related research.

## Configuration
The tool uses a configuration file to control the simulation parameters. Below is a sample configuration:

```ini

# Distributions
simbox_duration_distribution = 'WEIBULL'
probe_duration_distribution = 'POISON'
business_duration_distribution = 'NORMAL'
priv_duration_distribution = 'NORMAL'
multi_duration_distribution = 'NORMAL'

# Technical
start_date = '2024-05-01'
batch_size = 100000
detailed_resut_filename = 'results/cdr.csv'
agg_resut_filename = 'results/cdr_agg.csv'
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/fastcdrgen.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd fastcdrgen
   ```
3. Build the project using Rust's package manager, `cargo`:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Prepare Configuration File**:
   Customize the sample configuration file and save it as `config.toml`.

2. **Run the Generator**:
   Use the following command to generate the CDR dataset:
   ```bash
   ./fastcdrgen
   ```

3. **Output**:
   The generated dataset will be saved to the file specified in `resut_filename`.
